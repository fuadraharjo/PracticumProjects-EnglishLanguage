### Used Car Price Prediction Using Boosting Machine Learning Technique

`Rusty Bargain` is a used car for `buy and sell` company that is developing an app to attract new buyers. In this application, we can quickly find out the `market value of the car` that will be sold. We are asked to create a `machine learning model` to determine the market value of a car. The company already has historical data on vehicle prices along with parameters that determine car prices such as `vehicle technical specifications` and `vehicle model version`. We will use some `machine learning` models, especially models that use the `boosting` technique and some models that are not `boosting` as a comparison. The company `Rusty Bargain` is interested in:
- Predictive quality.
- The speed of the model in predicting.
- The time required to train the model.

We will test several well-known models using the dataset we have to determine the best of them:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost
