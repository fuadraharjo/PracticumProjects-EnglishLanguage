### Case Study: Factors Influencing Car Selling Prices

A car sales company called `Crankshaft List` wants to know what factors affect the selling price of a car. Hundreds of free vehicle advertisements are displayed on the company's website every day. We need to study datasets over the last few years and determine the factors that influence the price of a vehicle.

Factor analysis The selling price of a car is influenced by several factors, some of which are `model_year`, `model`, `condition`, `cylinders`, `fuel`, `odometer`, `transmission`, `type`, `paint_color`, ` is_4wd`. Is it true that the factors mentioned affect the selling price of the car?

Some of the hypotheses proposed to find out the 'Car Sales Price Factor' include:
- Is it true that the average selling price of cars owned by the `Crankshaft List` is around `USD 15000`?
- Is it true that the average age of cars sold on the `Crankshaft List` is around `2 years old`?
- Is it true that the average mileage of cars sold by `Crankshaft List` is around `200000 Miles`?
- Is it true that the average ad run time is `30 days` until the car is sold?
- Is it true that `truck` and `pickup` cars have a lot of advertisements?
- Is it true that the correlation between `'price'` and age `'age'` has a strong negative correlation?
- Is it true that `sedan` cars with `automatic` transmission types have a higher selling price compared to other types of transmissions?
- Is it true that `suv` cars with `manual` transmission types have a higher selling price compared to other types of transmissions?
- Is it true that a `sedan` car with a `red` color type has a higher selling price compared to other colors?
- Is it true that `suv` cars with `orange` color type have a higher selling price compared to other colors?
