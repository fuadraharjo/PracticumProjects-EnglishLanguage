### Trip Analysis of Taxi Service Users

A company called Zuber engaged in `ride-sharing` is a new company launched in Chicago looking to find patterns in the information available. Companies want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on trips. This analysis is a continuation of the previous analysis using SQL to obtain relevant data to be analyzed using Python. Several analyzes in the form of objectives and hypotheses proposed are listed as follows:
- Which taxi company has the highest number of trips on 15-16 November 2017
- Knowing the distribution of data on the number of trips from all companies on 15-16 November 2017
- Find out which favorite locations (`dropoff_location`) users visited during November 2017
- Knowing the distribution of data from the average trip at each drop-off location during November 2017
- Testing the hypothesis: Is it true that the average trip duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays
