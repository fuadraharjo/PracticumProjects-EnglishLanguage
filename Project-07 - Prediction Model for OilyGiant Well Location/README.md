### Prediction Model for OilyGiant Well Exploration Locations

A company named `OilyGiant` wants to explore oil in three areas. We are asked to determine which locations are suitable for exploration by taking into account their business aspects so as not to experience/reduce potential losses with a risk threshold below `2.5%` and obtain high profits. `OilyGiant` has a capital of `100 Million USD` with a `per barrel` price of oil is about `4.5 USD`.

The dataset derived from `OilyGiant` has several variables that affect the `oil content`. We will create a `machine-learning` model that can predict the location with the highest `oil volume content`. Then proceed with the `profit/profit margin` analysis and `risk` analysis using the `bootstrapping` technique. Some of the goals and formulation of the problem for this project include:
1. What are the criteria so that the `OilyGiant` company does not suffer losses?
2. How does the `machine learning model` perform against the dataset?
3. Which area is suitable for the location of the `200 point` well exploration?
4. What is the average `profit margin` of that area using `bootstrapping` technique?
5. What is the `confidence interval` for that location with a `95% confidence level`?

`Keywords`: oil exploration, predictive modeling, machine learning, profit margin analysis, risk analysis, bootstrapping technique
