### User Cellular Package Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

A mobile operator named `Megaline` is dissatisfied because many of their customers are
still using the old package. The company wants to develop a
model that can analyze consumer behavior and recommend one
of the two newest Megaline packages: `Smart` or `Ultra`.

`Megaline` has a dataset containing the behavior of users of the `Smart` and `Ultra` packages. Here we will load a `machine learning model` to determine which package to give based on customer behavior (`number of calls`, `call duration`, `sms`, `number of data packets`). In this project, the threshold for the accuracy level is 0.75.

Some of the objectives and formulation of the problem from this project analysis:
- Find out the best algorithm for `machine learning` model for `Megaline` dataset
- What is the best `Hyperparameter` in `machine learning` models
- Does the selected `machine learning model` meet the `sanity check`?
- Is it true that the selected `machine learning model` can test arbitrary data samples?
