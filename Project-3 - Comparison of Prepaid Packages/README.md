### Prepaid Plan Comparison Study: Surf vs. Ultimate in Megaline Company

An analyst at the telecom operator company `Megaline` was asked by the company to analyze two types of prepaid packages, namely `Surf` packages and `Ultimate` packages. The company's advertising department wanted to know which prepaid plans generated more revenue, so they could create an appropriate advertising budget.

We will conduct an initial analysis of these prepaid packages based on a relatively small sample of clients. we have 500 `Megaline` client data, which contains information such as: who they are, where they come from, what kind of package they use, and the number of calls and messages they sent in 2018. Our task is to analyze the behavior of the users, then determine which prepaid package is more profitable for `Megaline` companies.

The dataset owned by the company `Megaline` includes `'calls'`, `'internet'`, `'messages'`, `'plans'` and `'users'` which all contain important information for the analysis of this project. The purpose of this project is not only to find the most revenue from the two prepaid packages, but also to analyze user behavior such as 'call duration', 'number of sms' and 'amount of internet data usage' towards the two prepaid packages. Several hypotheses are proposed as follows:
- Is it true that `call duration` category from `Surf Plan` in a month is the most in number?
- Is it true that `sms count` category from `Surf Plan` in a month is the most in number?
- Is it true that the average amount of internet data usage per month for both types of `Prepaid Packages` is around `16 GB`?
- Is it true that the highest amount of revenue from users per month belongs to the `Ultimate Plan`?
- Is it true that the Average Income of Ultimate and Surf Prepaid Package Users is Different?
- Is the Average Income of Users in the NY-NJ Region Different from Other Regions?
