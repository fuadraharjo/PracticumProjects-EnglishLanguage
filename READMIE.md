# Practicum Projects in English Language

Contains a collection of projects that have been carried out from the assignment *`Sprint Project`* `[Online Bootcamp Practicum Indonesia - Data Scientist in Indonesian]`. This project contains various types of analysis to predictions, from `Data Pre-processing`, `Visualization`, `Statistical Test`, `Hypothesis Test`, `Model Prediction`, `Score Model Test`, and so on.

Analysis and Hypothesis Testing were involved in this project.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *math*, *scipy* |
| [Use of Trip Taxi Services](https://github.com/fuadraharjo/PracticumProjects-EnglishLanguage/blob/bcf167d0ddb129c17d101ca055ec41c03b0ca39c/Project-4/Trip%20analysis%20of%20taxi%20service%20users.ipynb) | Analysis of the preferences of taxi users from the Zuber company on several factors such as `dropoff location`, `company name` and hypothesis testing using *scipy*. | *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *re*, *scipy* |
| [Prediction Model of Cellular Packages](https://github.com/fuadraharjo/PracticumProjects-EnglishLanguage/blob/bcf167d0ddb129c17d101ca055ec41c03b0ca39c/Project-5/User%20cellular%20package%20prediction%20model%20using%20machine%20learning.ipynb) | Create a classification prediction model to determine suitable cellular packages for customers using libraries from *`scikit-learn`* | *pandas*, *sklearn* |
| [Prediction Model of Customer Churn](https://github.com/fuadraharjo/PracticumProjects-EnglishLanguage/blob/bcf167d0ddb129c17d101ca055ec41c03b0ca39c/Project-6/Bank%20customer%20churn%20prediction%20model%20using%20machine%20learning.ipynb) | The classification prediction model to determine which customers will `churn` uses the `scikit-learn` module and applies techniques such as `one hot encoding (OHE)`, `scaling features` and `balancing target`. | *pandas*, *sklearn*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn* |
| [Model Prediction of OilyGiant Well Location](https://github.com/fuadraharjo/PracticumProjects-EnglishLanguage/blob/bcf167d0ddb129c17d101ca055ec41c03b0ca39c/Project-7/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20OilyGiant%20Well%20Exploration%20Locations.ipynb) | Business analysis to reduce the risk of loss in locating exploratory wells using `machine learning` and `bootstrapping` techniques. | *pandas*, *numpy* *sklearn*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn* |
