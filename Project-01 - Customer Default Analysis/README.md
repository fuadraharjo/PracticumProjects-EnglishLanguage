### Analyzing Default Risk: Case Study of Islamic Banks

A `Islamic Bank` that implements `religion of Islam` shariah contract in its business processes where it only provides buying and selling services, not a contract of borrowing money with usury to the first party (`developer / seller`), second (`bank`) and third (` customer`). Customers who want something but are constrained by costs can use this facility, where goods are purchased by the bank and then resold at a higher margin to the customer by paying installments over a certain period of time. Our job is to prepare reports for the business division of a bank. We will find out the effect of a customer's marital status and the number of children he has on the probability of default in repayment of installments. The bank already has some data regarding the eligibility of the customer.

The main objective is to find out how big the risk of 'Default Paying' is carried out by customers based on several categories including 'Income Level', 'Family Status', 'Installment Purposes' and 'Number of Children' to be used by companies to assess potential customers. The hypotheses made for the `default` analysis include:
- Is it true that the highest rating is `Default` by customers with `Low Income Level`?
- Is it true that the highest rating is `Default` by customers with family status `Unmarried`?
- Is it true that the highest `Default` rating by customers with `Estate Purposes` installment?
- Is it true that the highest rating of `Default` by customers is with customers who are `No Children`?
